# dotfiles

This project is an attempt to standardize my workspace between my various machines (Mac, ChromeOS, Windows, Codespaces).  I'm probably not going to have everything working in all of those environments (specifically Windows), but that is ultimately my goal.

This repository is designed to be cloned directly into your $HOME directory (see "How to Store Dotfiles" in Reference section below).  You probably will want to `mv` everything into something like a .backup directory.

I'm in the process of building up the Neovim config files.  I'm impressed with the work chrisatmachine.com has done with LunarVim, so I'm using that heavily for my inspiration.

I've become a fan of Homebrew recently.  It solves the problem of installing more recent applications than distributions typically support, and is consistent between MacOS and all flavors of Linux I've tried thus far.
